# Foodie

## About

What if you could make some extra cash or get a discount on your meal just by walking to your next class? What if you could get food delivered right to your hand. Introducing, Foodie. 

Foodie allows university students to order food from campus cafes and have fellow students deliver it directly to them for a small fee. If you're headed across campus for your next class, and there's a cafe along the way, why not make an extra buck?

Open the app, select the cafe and where you're going, and find all your peers that want to get fed.



Why Foodie?
1. Cheap and direct
    - Much smaller fee than uber eats etc
    - Students know the campus better than external parties
2. Profit to the students
    - Foodie doesn't take any money
    - All fees remain within the student community
3. Inspiring a community

This project was conceptualised, planned, and implemented within 24 hours at the 2017 Facebook Sydney Hackathon.
